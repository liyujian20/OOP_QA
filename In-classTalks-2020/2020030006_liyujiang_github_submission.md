Progress report 2 on final project

My project: rectilinear steiner trees

My progress: I have already finished problem a , where I wrote an adapter class for Flute, but it seems that some times the program give an abnormal answer where the length of the tree is a negative number if I visit tree.length directly, but answers are correct if I calculate the length by calling function wirelength(tree), the answers are always correct. This bug needs to be further tested, but my partner claim that he has never met the bug, maybe it can be considered that my group have finished problem a.

For problem b, I have already implemented the Prim algorithm to calculate the tree. But the algorithm has a relatively large error, and my partner is still working on (or have finished) the bga algorithm.

We haven’t started problem c yet .

Deadline: I think we haven’t got very much left, but it would be ideal for me if the deadline for the final project could be postponed so that we can continue after we have finished our final exams. Maybe at the end of June.
